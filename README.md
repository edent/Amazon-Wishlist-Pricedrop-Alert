# Amazon Wishlist Pricedrop Alert
Emails you when items on your wishlist drop in price. You'll need to add your own Wishlist URl and your own mailserver details.

Stick it in your `crontab` to get regular price alerts. Amazon can be a bit suspicious of screen scraping, so I'd recommend no more than once per day.

There are a couple of minor annoyances.

* Some prices fluctuate by pennies. Perhaps you only want to know if the price is lower by more than Â£1, or more than 10%?
* No tracking the lowest price. Do you want to know if it's the lowest price in the last few weeks?
* Doesn't automatically buy stuff. It would be nice to just buy a book any time it drops to be lower than a quid.
